            I could not have made this website without my dear cat, Anubis (Nunu for short).
            His support allowed me to push myself and be a better student. He helped me 
            plenty when I was stuck (see: him at the desk, hard at work), and continues to
            inspire me every day. Thank you Nunu, my life (and project) wouldn't be the same
            without you. I've included a countdown to his birthday in the bottom left, 
            which will be coming soon.
            He will be turning: 
            <div id = "nunu-age"> Nunu's Age: 
            </div>
            <script>
                document.getElementById("nunu-age").textContent = 
                nunuNewAgeString; //example of converting between a number and text 
            </script>
